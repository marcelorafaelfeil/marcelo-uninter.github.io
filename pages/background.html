  <h1>Background</h1>

  <p>
    I have degree in the life school. I am working as a software developer since 2010 and on this way I could learn
    with important people that taught me everything in practice, day by day.
  </p>
  <p>
    My knowledge was put under test for many times when I was on charge to develop solutions for important clients like:
    <div class="text-center">
      <ul class="inline-block text-left">
        <li>Senior Sistemas</li>
        <li>Porto Seguros</li>
        <li>Unimed</li>
        <li>Petrobr√°s</li>
        <li>Philips</li>
        <li>Ambev</li>
        <li>Natixis</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    I do not believe that a simple paper signed by someone nobody knows can testify about the knowledge and experience
    of someone, but the life of thousands and thousands people that were impacted by the software that someone created
    this can testify about that.
