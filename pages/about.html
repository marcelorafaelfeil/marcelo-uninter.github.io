    About me
  </h1>
  <p>
    I have been working as a software developer for more than 10 years and I worked in many different contexts for
    different companies. I have experience in front and backend develpoment and I am very interested on the both side.
    I had the opportunity to work in big companies like Ambev and Philips on their core systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now I am working for Natixis that belongs to the group BPCE on Europe context. And my plan is to offer my job to the
    companis outside from Brazil for three reasons: To live new experiences, to improve my english and, obviously, make
    money.
